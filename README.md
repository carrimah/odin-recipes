## Stylistic Choices
For this project I have chosen to use the Brutalist aesthetic because I like it. I don't like minimalism but I do like what I call "stylistic emptiness"- the intentional use of space (and lack thereof). I like challenging myself to show my tastes in different ways. Here I want to express myself with careful color and lines rather than add more.

**NOTE:** This is subject to change. I like to change my mind (hehe).
