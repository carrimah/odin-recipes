    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 salmon fillets - 6 ounces each, 1-inch thick, skin on, pin bones removed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt - or ¼ teaspoon of any other salt, including Morton kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>Optional: 4 lemon slices - ¼-inch thick</li>
        <li>Optional: 2 tablespoons parsley - chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blot the salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Season them with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried thyme.</li>
        <li>Heat a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil and butter and swirl to coat. You can also use a nonstick skillet.</li>
        <li>When the butter starts foaming, add the salmon fillets, skin-side-down. If using, add the lemon slices.</li>
        <li>Cook the salmon, undisturbed, until the skin is crispy and browned, for about 4 minutes. Flip the salmon and lemon slices, lower the heat to medium, and continue cooking for 3 more minutes.</li>
        <li>If your fillets are 1 inch thick, cook the edges for about 2 minutes per side. This helps ensure the salmon reaches an internal temperature of 145ºF.</li>
        <li>Transfer the salmon fillets to a serving plate and drizzle them with the pan juices. Garnish the plate with lemon slices and chopped parsley, and serve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If your salmon is frozen, thaw it thoroughly before using it in this recipe. You can thaw it overnight in the fridge. </li>
        <li>You can skip the olive oil and use two tablespoons of butter. The butter's milk solids have a blackening effect, making the salmon extra-crispy.</li>
        <li>The best skillets for this recipe are nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillets. I don't recommend using a stainless steel skillet - the salmon skin tends to stick to it.</li>
        <li>Don't forget to drizzle the salmon with the pan juices after you've arranged it on the plates. The pan sauce is delicious.</li>
        <li>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to three days. I prefer to avoid reheating them because reheating can dry them out and make them taste fishy. Instead, I crumble them cold over a salad.</li>
    </ul>
