                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Toast the chilies in a dry skillet,</b> being careful not to burn. This will allow them to release their oils. Cover with water, bring to a boil, and let simmer and soften until you are ready to add them to the stew. <b>Drain the water and remove the seeds.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Season the meat</b> generously with salt and pepper and brown it in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Set it aside. (If you are in a hurry, you can skip the browning step and add it raw to the stew, but browning makes it more flavorful.)</li>
                    <li>Heat oil in an Instant pot on the saute setting (or large Dutch oven over medium heat) and add onion and garlic, stirring and sauteing until fragrant, tender, and golden. Once softened and golden, add all the spices: cloves, allspice, cumin, coriander, chili powder, oregano, bay leaves, and cinnamon– and saute for 2 minutes, toasting them. Add the optional tomatoes and the beef stock. Stir and scrape up any browned bits.</li>
                    <li> Add the <b>browned meat</b> and stir.  </li>
                    <li><b>Add the softened chilies on top.</b></li>
                    <li><b>INSTANT POT:</b> Set the instant pot to 45 minutes on high pressure. Let it naturally release.</li>
                    <li><b>Dutch Oven:</b>If using a dutch oven, cover tightly, and simmer gently on the stovetop, on low heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until meat is very tender.  Stir every hour. (Alternativly bake in a 350F oven). </li>
                    <li><b>SLOW COOKER:</b> Place this in a slow cooker on low for 8 hours.</li>
                    <li><b>Optional:</b> Once the meat is tender, fish out the chilies, and blend with a cup of the warm broth in a blender until pureed. Return to the pot, stirring it in. Shred the meat with two forks. You can also just leave the chilies whole. </li>
                    <li><b>Season:</b> Taste and season, adding a teaspoon or two of vinegar and adjusting salt and pepper to taste. If it tastes bland, it likely needs salt.</li>
                    <li><b>Make Birria Tacos:</b> Dip tortillas into the rich broth, lightly coating each side and place in a greased skillet, over medium heat, top with cheese, birria stew meat, and any fixings.  Fold the over ( like a quesadilla) and pan-sear each side until crispy. Keep warm in the oven until serving.</li>

                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Chilies: </b>Use dry mild chilies like Guajillo and Pasilla Chiles to add flavor and depth – but not too much heat. (Feel free to use other dried chilies, paying attention to heat level.) Add Chipotle for more heat and smoky flavor. If you want a milder stew, I suggest using only Guajillos (like 6). You can always add more spice at the end (cayenne, chili flakes, chipotle powder) if not sure. <b>Using dried chilies really makes this dish, but they must be toasted and simmered to remove bitterness.</b></li>
                    <li>If you prefer a brothier stew, you can always add more chicken or beef broth at the end of cooking, seasoning with a little more salt.</li>
                    <li>Tomatoes: I have made this with and without tomatoes. Both are delicious. I almost prefer this without. </li>
                    <li><b>MEAT:</b> I used a mixture of lamb and beef. Tougher cuts of meat work great here like stew meat. Shoulder, shank, leg, etc. Goat meat is traditional.</li>
                    <li><b>To Remove Fat:</b> Make the stew ahead and cool – the fat will solidify at the top and then can be easily removed.</li>

                    <li>salt, to taste</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>¼ cup water</li>
                    <li>¼ to ½ small serrano chile</li>
                    <li>10 cloves garlic, divided</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound skirt steak, 1/2″ thick</li>
                    <li>salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                <h4>The Chimichurri</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and salt until well combined. Set it aside until ready to use.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>The Marinade</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the orange juice, olive oil, water, serrano chile, and 3 garlic cloves to the blender. Process until you get a smooth mixture. Add the salt. Process again to combine. Pour the marinade into a large container or a large resealable Ziploc bag.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>The Steak</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finely chop the remaining 7 garlic cloves and add them to the marinade. Place the skirt steak in the marinade and refrigerate it for 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry with a paper towel. Season it with salt and pepper to taste on all sides.</li>
                    <li>Place a cast iron skillet or a large pan over high heat. Let it heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vegetable oil and let it heat up for another minute. Add the seasoned steak and sear it for 3 to 4 minutes; flip it over and let it cook for 2 to 4 minutes on the other side for a medium-rare steak, or to an internal temperature of 130˚F to 135˚F.</li>
                    <li><b>Cook it for another minute or so if you like your steak a little more cooked.</b> Use a Meat Thermometer to check for doneness.</li>
                    <li>Remove the steak from the skillet and set it on a cutting board. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In the meantime, make the jus. Return the skillet to the burner and reduce the heat to medium. Pour the beef broth into the skillet and, using a wooden spatula, gently scrape the bottom of the skillet to remove any browned bits from when the steak was cooking. Season with salt to taste, and let it reduce for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the steak against the grain into 1" slices. Set them on a serving plate and pour the jus on top.</li>
                    <li>Serve with chimichurri on the side, and enjoy.</li>

            <div class="recipe-notes">
                <h3>Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Steak options:</b> Churrasco steak is generally made with skirt steak, about 1/2-inch in thickness. But flank steak is a good alternative.</li>
                    <li><b>Orange juice:</b> If you can, use freshly squeezed orange juice, but you can also use store-bought orange juice.</li>
                    <li><b>Chile options:</b> You can use a jalapeno instead. In both cases, I recommend seeding the pepper.</li>
                    <li><b>Jus:</b> This is a fancy word for a simple sauce made from the caramelization of animal proteins on a hot pan.</li>
                    <li><b>Don’t crowd the pan:</b> If you crowd the pan, not only will the steak not brown properly, but it will release all of its moisture, leaving you with a tough, dry finished product. If you want to double the recipe, don’t cook two steaks in the same skillet simultaneously.</li>
                    <li><b>Let it rest:</b> After cooking, let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes. This will allow the juices to settle in the meat, producing a more flavorful, juicy steak. Cutting against the grain makes steak more tender and easier to chew.</li>
                    <li><b>Grilled Churrasco:</b> To grill the steaks, place them on a preheated grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Two minutes will yield medium-rare steaks, while three minutes will get you closer to medium-well. Remove them from the heat and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
                    <li><b>Steak doneness.</b> The ideal internal temperature for grilled skirt steak is 130°F for rare, 135°F medium-rare, 145°F medium, 150°F medium well, and 160°F for well done. Keep in mind that meat will continue to rise a few degrees once it’s off the grill.</li>
