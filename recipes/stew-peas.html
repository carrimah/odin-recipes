    <p>A Jamaican Stew Peas Recipe sourced from <a href="https://chefsamanthageorge.com/jamaican-stew-peas-with-pigtails-and-beef/">Chef Samantha George</a>.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb cured pigtails</li>
        <li>1-2 lb beef stew chunks</li>
        <li>2 cups red peas (dried)</li>
        <li>4 cups of water</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1 large onion (diced)</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger grated</li>
        <li>6 Pimentos seeds (whole)</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns (grounded)</li>
        <li>2-3 green Scotch bonnet peppers (whole)</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot (peeled and diced)</li>
        <li>2 tsp thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 stalk scallion (diced)</li>
        <li>½ green sweet/bell pepper (diced)</li>
        <li>½ cup Coconut milk (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the pigtails overnight in a mixing bowl full of water in the refrigerator to remove excess salt and discard the water and set the pigtail aside.   If you’re short on time, just when you’re ready to cook the dish, bring a soup pot halfway full of water, cook the pigtails, boil them for about 30 minutes, and discard the salinized water.</li>
        <li>Rinse the red peas to remove any residues.  Soak for about half-hour in 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Place the pigtails, beef, peas with soaking water, garlic, onion, and ginger in a pressure cooker. Pour in 4 more cups of water, then seal and pressure cook for about 30 minutes until the peas and meats are tender.  NB. (Take care to follow the pressure-cooking instructions that came with its manual.)</li>
        <li>Now it’s time to finish the stew. To do this, use a large, slotted spoon to remove 1 cup of the cooked peas and add them to a blender along with 1 cup of the stew liquid and coconut milk along with 1 tbsp corn starch. </li>
        <li>Blend this mixture into a thick soup then pour this creamy mixture back into the pot and stir well to combine. Add diced carrots and simmer on medium heat for about another 5 minutes until the gravy has thickened and the carrots are cooked.</li>
        <li>Add the thyme leaves, and sweet peppers, and simmer for another 3 minutes.  Serve hot over warm steamed white/ cauliflower rice and a side of garden salad.</li>
    </ol>
