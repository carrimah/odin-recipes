        <li>Cast iron Skillet</li>
        <li>Instant Read Meat Thermometer</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Chimichurri</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon lime juice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon lime zest</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ to ½ small serrano chile</li>
        <li>10 cloves garlic, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Steak</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound skirt steak, 1/2″ thick</li>
        <li>salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ cup beef broth</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>The Chimichurri</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, combine the parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, lime juice, lime zest, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and salt until well combined. Set it aside until ready to use.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Marinade</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the orange juice, olive oil, water, serrano chile, and 3 garlic cloves to the blender. Process until you get a smooth mixture. Add the salt. Process again to combine. Pour the marinade into a large container or a large resealable Ziploc bag.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>The Steak</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the remaining 7 garlic cloves and add them to the marinade. Place the skirt steak in the marinade and refrigerate it for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry with a paper towel. Season it with salt and pepper to taste on all sides.</li>
        <li>Place a cast iron skillet or a large pan over high heat. Let it heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the vegetable oil and let it heat up for another minute. Add the seasoned steak and sear it for 3 to 4 minutes; flip it over and let it cook for 2 to 4 minutes on the other side for a medium-rare steak, or to an internal temperature of 130˚F to 135˚F.</li>
        <li><b>Cook it for another minute or so if you like your steak a little more cooked.</b> Use a Meat Thermometer to check for doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the skillet and set it on a cutting board. Let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, make the jus. Return the skillet to the burner and reduce the heat to medium. Pour the beef broth into the skillet and, using a wooden spatula, gently scrape the bottom of the skillet to remove any browned bits from when the steak was cooking. Season with salt to taste, and let it reduce for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the skillet from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the steak against the grain into 1" slices. Set them on a serving plate and pour the jus on top.</li>
        <li>Serve with chimichurri on the side, and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Steak options:</b> Churrasco steak is generally made with skirt steak, about 1/2-inch in thickness. But flank steak is a good alternative.</li>
        <li><b>Orange juice:</b> If you can, use freshly squeezed orange juice, but you can also use store-bought orange juice.</li>
        <li><b>Chile options:</b> You can use a jalapeno instead. In both cases, I recommend seeding the pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Jus:</b> This is a fancy word for a simple sauce made from the caramelization of animal proteins on a hot pan.</li>
        <li><b>Don’t crowd the pan:</b> If you crowd the pan, not only will the steak not brown properly, but it will release all of its moisture, leaving you with a tough, dry finished product. If you want to double the recipe, don’t cook two steaks in the same skillet simultaneously.</li>
        <li><b>Let it rest:</b> After cooking, let the steak rest for at least 5 minutes. This will allow the juices to settle in the meat, producing a more flavorful, juicy steak. Cutting against the grain makes steak more tender and easier to chew.</li>
        <li><b>Grilled Churrasco:</b> To grill the steaks, place them on a preheated grill and cook for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Two minutes will yield medium-rare steaks, while three minutes will get you closer to medium-well. Remove them from the heat and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting.</li>
        <li><b>Steak doneness.</b> The ideal internal temperature for grilled skirt steak is 130°F for rare, 135°F medium-rare, 145°F medium, 150°F medium well, and 160°F for well done. Keep in mind that meat will continue to rise a few degrees once it’s off the grill.</li>
